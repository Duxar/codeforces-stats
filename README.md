Codeforces Stats
================

I wrote these scripts to get a view of my stats on Codeforces. Maybe over time I will add features. I used Codeforces API and the data they provide.

Features
--------

```
get_cf_stats_user.py
```

Gets all the solved problem for a specific user and write a JSON in a file. Also it keeps for each problem the name, tags, contest points and the number of users that solved that problem.


```
generate_page.py
```

Parse the file generated by the other script and counts how many problems of each category (dp, graphs, dfs, dsu, greedy ...) were solved and also plots a graph that represents the solved count (how many users solved that problem) for each solved problem. To generate the graph problems were sorted by solved count in descending order so first problems were solved by many users and the last ones by few.


Dependencies
------------

0. Python 3.x - the differences are not very big but some tweaks are needed to use Python 2.x
0. requests library
0. [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - for plotting the data
